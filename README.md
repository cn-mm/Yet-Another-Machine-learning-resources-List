# Yet Another Machine learning resources List

Logging all the resources I have (and hopefully will) found useful in learning and understanding Machine Learning. I often run out of memory trying to retrive concepts and use posts, papers and articles as a convenient refresher.

## The Breakdown
The repository is partitioned by broad domains, as follows
1. [Machine Learning Foundations](./MLF.md)
2. [Computer Vision](./CV.md)
3. [NLP](./NLP.md)
4. [Graph Neural Networks](./GNN.md)
5. [Reinforcement Learning](./RL.md)

## Stats (TODO)



## Misc
